Traced the caveat back to the original 2018 "Known issues" section and showed that Android now applies TextInput borders through the same per-edge path as any other view, with no multiline special case. The maintainer confirmed the behaviour on a physical device, and the correction was applied to the current docs plus every versioned copy from 0.81 to 0.87. Reviewed and merged by Simek.',

Measured the exact threshold with a widget-test harness, then made the controls scroll horizontally so every control stays reachable, keeping the file explorer button pinned so the wide layout is unchanged. Added regression tests at five widths, each verified to fail without the fix. Approved and merged by srawlins.',
